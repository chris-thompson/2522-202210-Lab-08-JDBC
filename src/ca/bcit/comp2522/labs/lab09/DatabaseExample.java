/**
 * Demonstrates how to communicate with a MySQL database installed on localhost.
 *
 * I have created a MySQL poweruser for you. This MySQL poweruser can create new databases on my computer.
 *
 * Username: comp2522
 * Password: I was born in 1973
 *
 * I've included an sql file called comp2522.sql that you can use in MySQL Workbench on your development
 * computer to create the simple schema. There is one table. You will need to add the poweruser to your
 * local development rig in order to test your code before submitting it.
 *
 * I would like you to modify the Java program you are reading so that it adds a row to the table called users.
 *
 * It's just a proof of concept. Easy-peasy. That's all!
 *
 * First you must download the MySQL Java JDBC Connector from here: https://www.mysql.com/products/connector/
 *
 * Unzip it, and add the jar file in it to the list of libraries in your project properties.
 *
 * I will execute your code on my computer. Hopefully your program will add a row to my table!
